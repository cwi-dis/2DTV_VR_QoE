# Subjective assessment of dynamic point clouds in traditional and VR viewing conditions
This repository collects the data gathered in a subjective study comparing the quality in three viewing conditions: 2DTV, 3DoF, 6DoF. Data includes subjective quality ratings, simulator sickness questionnaire answers, and igroup presence questionnaire answers.

The original dynamic sequences can be found here: http://plenodb.jpeg.org/pc/8ilabs - https://zenodo.org/record/3662390#.YaCVzPHML0p

Scripts to generate the distorted stimuli from the original data will be added soon.
